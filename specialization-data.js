/*
 * NATIONAL SPECIALIZATION DATA
 * ----------------------------
 * The four category pools players choose from in Step 1, plus the
 * military-specific list used in Step 2. Defense items are pulled out of
 * the general Heavy Industry pool so they're reserved for the military
 * step rather than also being pickable as a regular specialization.
 *
 * Step 1's five slots are tied to the land bio's own World Exports
 * ranking, not freely chosen from the whole economy type - see
 * EXPORT_LABEL_TO_POOLS / poolsForExportLabel below.

// ---- Required Imports (by chosen specialization) ----
//
// For each specialization a player can pick in Step 1, which OTHER
// specializations (drawn from this same closed set of 122 - not generic
// invented goods) a nation built around that industry would realistically
// need to import, since no claim produces every input its own economy
// needs. Every string in every list below is itself a valid key in
// SPECIALIZATION_POOLS - one nation's export is another's import, all
// within the same economic model this file already uses elsewhere. Most
// of this table's dependency chains were hand-authored (design pass, not
// auto-generated) to reflect realistic supply chains - General Machinery,
// Energy - Fossil Fuels, and the various Metals/Electronics entries are
// common inputs across many industries, matching how heavily real-world
// economies lean on machinery, energy, and refined materials as base
// inputs. "Cargo Transportation - Road" absorbed what were originally
// separate "Commercial Transportation - Road" references - that name
// doesn't exist in SPECIALIZATION_POOLS (only Cargo Transportation - Road
// does), and the two had identical dependency lists anyway.
//
// A set of specializations are deliberately left OUT of this table -
// either because they're knowledge/labor-based work with no concrete
// goods chain behind them (Hospitality - Cultural Activities, Hospitality
// - Sex Work, Consulting, Financial services - Investment management,
// Professional services - Accounting, Professional services - Legal
// services, Professional services - Management consulting), or because
// they were deliberately scoped out of this pass (Gambling, Financial
// services - Banking, Financial services - Insurance). They're still
// fully pickable in Step 1 like any other specialization -
// importsForSpecialization just returns an empty list for them, and the
// Summary panel shows "No specific imports required" rather than
// inventing a chain. They also never appear as an import FOR anything
// else below.
//
// Purely descriptive flavor text for the Summary panel - not wired into
// any other mechanic (energy/food/GDP) in this file. Every other entry in
// SPECIALIZATION_POOLS should have a matching key here; if pools are
// edited, re-sync this table the same pass (aside from the deliberate
// omissions above), and make sure any new/renamed entry used as an
// import value is still spelled exactly as it appears in
// SPECIALIZATION_POOLS.
