 * LAND BIO GENERATOR
 * -------------------
 * This is the only file you need to touch to change how land bios are
 * written. map.js calls window.generateLandBio(provinces) when someone
 * hits "Generate Land Bio".
 *
 * `provinces` is an array of the claimed province objects, in the order
 * they were claimed. Each one looks like:
 *
 *   {
 *     id: "path123",
 *     label: "S42",              // display name (rename these in data.js
 *                                 // once real province names exist)
 *     continent: "south",        // "north" or "south"
 *     fill: "#78b464",
 *     econ: "Agriculture Oriented",
 *     climate: {
 *       dominant: "Oceanic",
 *       breakdown: { "Oceanic": 87.4, "Semi-Arid": 12.6 }
 *     },
 *     isCapital: false           // true for at most one province - set on
 *                                 // the map by clicking the star next to a
 *                                 // claimed province in the sidebar list
 *   }
 *
 * generateLandBio returns (or resolves to, if you make it async — see the
 * note at the bottom) an object: { text, bbcCode }
 *   - text: the prose paragraph shown on the bio page
 *   - bbcCode: a forum-ready BBC-code version of the same claim, shown as
 *     the "Copy BBC Code" button's clipboard content
 *
 * Both are built from one shared computeEconomics() pass so the numbers
 * in the prose and the numbers in the BBC code always match — if you add
 * more output formats later, feed them from that same object rather than
 * recomputing sector splits again (each computation re-rolls the dice).
 *
 * Also included below: ECON_SECTOR_CONFIG and computeSectorSplit(), which
 * randomize a Services / Manufacturing / Extraction breakdown for each
 * province based on its econ category, per-generation. See the comment
 * above ECON_SECTOR_CONFIG for how to hard-code these instead later.

//
// A single descriptive label for the claim's overall economic character,
// derived from the aggregate Services / Light Industry / Heavy Industry /
// Extraction totals. Checked in two tiers:
//
//   1. The four "pure" economies (>50% in one sector alone). At most one
//      of these can ever be true at once, since two sectors can't each
//      individually exceed 50% of a 100% total.
//   2. Only if none of those match, the six blended two-sector economies
//      (>50% combined). Multiple of these CAN be true simultaneously
//      (e.g. Services+Light both also make Services+Extraction pass if
//      Extraction is nonzero), so whichever has the largest combined
//      percentage wins.
//
// Tier 1 has to be checked first and separately - if every candidate were
// thrown into one flat "largest percentage wins" pool, a pure economy
// would almost never win, since adding any second sector's percentage on
// top of it only makes the combined number bigger. That would make the
// four pure economies effectively unreachable.

const ECONOMY_DESCRIPTIONS = {
  "Service Economy": "Service Economies are highly specialized economies in which the tertiary sector is the dominant force in the economy. The tertiary sector consists of activities where people offer their knowledge and time to improve productivity, performance, potential, and sustainability. Unlike goods services are intangible in nature. The goal of the economy is to export services, while importing finished goods, consumer goods, and services from other states. Competition, demand, and trade will shape the service industry dramatically. The state is heavily reliant on imported goods of all kinds. Competition can be fierce so finding a specialized market is ideal. Pollution is minimal.",

  "Consumer Goods Economy": "Consumer Goods Economies are highly specialized in the light secondary sector. They are focused on the creation of consumer goods, as contrasted by industrial economies which are oriented towards intermediate and final products. The goal of the economy is to export its consumer goods while importing raw material, finished goods, and services from other states. The resources on hand, trade, and the priorities of your nation will influence what type of refinement and manufacturing will take place within the country. The state is reliant on importation of raw materials from other states to be manufactured into consumer goods, as well as needing finished goods and services. Competition can be high so finding a specialized market is ideal. Pollution is a concern for many of these economies but investment into cleaner practices can help limit such issues.",

Resource economies have various forms depending on the natural resources available. The goal of the economy is to export its raw materials while importing finished goods, consumer goods, and services from other states. The natural resources at your disposal will influence what type of production will take place within the country ie extraction of raw materials or cultivation of agriculture. The state is reliant on importation of goods and services. Although considered at the of the international economy resource based nations are the foundation of the economic order allowing them the power to severely damage the economics of unfriendly nations through embargoes. Environmental damage is a concern for many of these economies from mining and fracking to soil erosion and pesticide usage.",

The economy is focused on creating and selling consumer goods. The service sector and the light manufacturing sector are the primary outputs of your economy, making up a sizable portion of the economy.

  "Non-Industrial Economy": "Non-industrial Economies are based around Primary and Tertiary activities. The economy is focused on raw material extraction and services. Services and Extraction are the primary outputs of your economy, making up a sizable portion of the economy. These economies usually emerge from resource rich nations who have grown economically to the point of supporting a large Service industry but have not caught up infrastructure to support a secondary sector. The existence of the service economy is almost entirely reliant on the raw resource and usually is the source of wealth of the consumers and or focus of the service industry through the trade of resource. Commonly found in petrol states, it is considered highly unstable and many attempt to use the momentary wealth to diversify the economy either through creating a strong independent service economy bypassing the other or the catching up of the other sectors to build a more stable basis. The state is reliant on the importation of most goods. Environmental damage is a concern for many of these economies from mining and fracking to soil erosion and pesticide usage.",

  "Diversified Economy": "Diversified Economies have no single sector, or pair of sectors, that clearly dominates output - Services, Manufacturing, and Extraction each contribute a meaningful share. This spread-out base can make the economy more resilient to a downturn in any one sector, but also means it lacks the sharp specialization (and the trade leverage that comes with it) of a more focused economy. Trade tends to be broad rather than deep, importing and exporting across many categories instead of concentrating on one export and a handful of imports.",
